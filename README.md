Welcome to AiKit, the AI Agent Application Development Kit

Before using this kit, ensure that you have already installed the Fynal-AI services. If not, please install them first.

Get your APM (Agent Package Manager) services access points, for example: `localhost:8888`; you will need to input it later to start a new project.

AiKit provides a set of tools to help you develop your own AI agent services in different languages
Currently, [Node.js version](nodejs/README.md) and Python versions are available.

If you use languages like Java or Go and would like to contribute , we welcome you to start a PR. Thank you in advance!
